== ScrumPoker

ScrumPoker is a web-application that allows teams to perform agile estimation using the popular "poker" planning game.
This application allows Scrum Masters to sign up for access, create new planning games, and estimate a list of 
planning items.  After creating a game and loading planning items, the Scrum Master will invite the team members
by sending them a URL through whatever means.
